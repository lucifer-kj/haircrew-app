# TO-DO: User Flow & UX Improvements Checklist (Context7 Adaptive)

> **Purpose:** This checklist identifies all improvement opportunities and fixes for user flows, UX, and admin/customer journeys. Each item is subdivided for clarity. No solutions are includedâ€”only actionable opportunities. All changes should be non-destructive and preserve existing logic.

## 1. Error Handling & Feedback

## 2. Navigation, Redirects, and Access Control
- [X] Add session expiry handling: redirect to login with a clear message

## 3. Form Validation & Accessibility
- [X] Ensure all forms use both client-side and server-side validation (e.g., Zod)
- [X] Display all validation errors inline and accessibly

> **Context7 Adaptive Note:**
> - All improvements should be implemented incrementally and tested in isolation.
> - Use feature flags or staged rollouts for major changes.
> - Always preserve existing business logic and user data.
> - Review each change for non-destructive impact before merging.
